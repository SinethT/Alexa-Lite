#### Description:
  
  **'Alexa Lite'** is a lightweight virtual assistant software entirely developed with Python. It is similar to popular voice assistants like [Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa), [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com/), and [Apple Siri](https://www.apple.com/siri/). But it doesn't powerful as those supreme-level voice assistants. It's just an entry-level voice assistant. But it can perform basic tasks such as playing music, telling jokes, etc. Because of that, I used this name for this voice assistant. Users can get an entry-level experience in voice assistants by using this. Users are primarily interacting with a natural voice. They can save time on typing by using a voice assistant like this. So because of that, they can exploit their time. And this is free for everyone. We are hoping to develop this more in the future.
